    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Prior Work</h3>
    <p>
      This site is a full implementation of the <a href = https://jamesbhall423.github.io/wdd130/activity_scheduler/site-plan.html>Wdd130 activity scheduler site</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to coordinate schedules with friends and acquaintances,
      to allow any member of a group to propose an activity that every member can attend,
      and to carry notifications of said proposals to other members of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website is not a general communications application.
      Its utility is limited to when activities are scheduled, not what those activities are.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      <!--The audicence should be as broad as possible. -->
      The audience consists of everyone 12 and older.
      The idea is to reach out to groups of casually connected individuals, rather than formal clubs where people are free to join or leave.
      Most people may interact with this on a mobile device.
      Some of the group meetings may be between different kinds of people.
      For groups of around 4-5.

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Merriweather
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Roboto
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, this is a normal paragraph.
       It should be okay to read this. It will be boring, though.
        This is just a test to see how the fonts work.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Hello, this is a colored paragraph.
       It should be okay to read this.
       It should be slightly more interesting than the other paragraph.
        This is just a test to see how the fonts and colors work.

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    
    <nav class="main_nav">
      <a href="activity-scheduler.html">Activity Scheduler</a>
      <a href="other-users.html">Other Users</a>
      <a href="schedule-rules.html">Schedule Rules</a>
      <a href="notification-center.html">Event Center</a>
      <a href="account.html">Account Info</a>
    </nav> 
    <hr>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The site requires five things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Login</li>
          <li>Other User Authentication</li>
          <li>Rules for availability</li>
          <li>The activity scheduler module</li>
          <li>Event center</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are defined as follows</p>
        <h3>Login</h3>
        <p>
          Not to be implemented at this point in time.
          However, each user needs to have their own account.
          Each account will need to have the following information:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Their schedule</li>
          <li>List of users who they have authorized to see their schedule and send them notifications</li>
          <li>List of users who have authorized them</li>
          <li>The activity scheduler module</li>
          <li>Events received</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There needs to be an account page, as well as a login page.
          The account page at least needs a logout and a delete account.
          More complicated account proceedures include changing passwords
           and protection against destructive actions (like accidentally deleting account).
          These can be implemented if time permits.
        </p>
        <h3>Other User Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          This represents a place where users can authorize other users to contact them and view their schedule.
          At the top, we have an image for the user and their username.
          Then we text input for the name of the user to add and a button to add them.
          Below that we have of list of authorized individuals each one as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The username</li>
          <li>An icon to represent whether they've reciprocated.</li>
          <li>A checkbox to authorize or de-authorize that individual</li>
          <li>A deletion button.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rules for availability</h3>
        <p>
          A rule is composed of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A start date and an end date</li>
          <li>Whether it is on or off on each day of the week</li>
          <li>Whether it represents available time or unavailable time.</li>
          <li>A start time hr:mn:am/pm and an end time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The rule page will be composed of a button to add rules, and a list of rules such that 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drop down menus for the year, month, and day of the start date and also drop down menus for the year month, and day of the end date</li>
          <li>Drop down menus for start hour, 30 minute interval, with am/pm being kept track by using 24-hour time, and also drop down menus for the end time. (Updated)</li>
          <li>A checkbox to indicate whether the rule is active</li>
          <li>A delete icon to remove the rule (ideally should pop up confirmation window)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Event Center</h3>
        <p>This page will have a list of activities, where each activity will have the following.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Date</li>
          <li>Start time and end time</li>
          <li>Name or description.</li>
          <li>Names of other participants.</li>
          <li>Delete button</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Actitity Scheduler Module</h3>
        <p>
          This represents a place where people actually see availability and propose activities.
          Use requires adding all group members, setting the date, and scrolling down to the available time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scroll listing group members checkbox if in group</li>
          <li>Scroll for times at 30 minute intervals, colored differently based on availability</li>
          <li>Clicking or tapping on time brings up activity schedule form</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Overall</h3>
        <p>Every page will have a link to the other pages in the header and a copywrite in the footer. (updated)</p>
        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>The site should have the following images</p>
        <ol>
          <li><img src="https://www.freeiconspng.com/uploads/check-confirm-ok-button-tick-yes-icon--18.png" width="35" alt="check, confirm, ok button, tick, yes icon "><a href="https://www.freeiconspng.com/img/3107">check, confirm, ok button, tick, yes icon </a></li>

      <img src = "images/AuthenticationWireframe.png" alt="other authentication wireframe">

      <p>
        All pages should use same standard five-link nav bar, regardless of wireframe.
        Link to site plan kept in footer as it could help visitors understand the site.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Responsiveness">
      <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
      <h3>Login page</h3>
      <p>
        The natural starting place is the login page.
        Logging in should take the user to the event center page.
        When a user creates an account, send them to the rules page.
        If logged in on page, user should remain logged in when clicking on in-site links.
        When logged in, each page should start by bringing in the relavant data.
      </p>
      <h3>Account page</h3>
      <p>
        The account page has two buttons.
        The logout button should logout the user and return the user to the login page.
        The remove account button should remove the user's account from the database,
         remove all references to that user in "other user authentication"
         and the associated section of the activity scheduler page.
        It should not remove the references in the event center.
      </p>
      <h3>Other User Authorization Page</h3>
      <p>
        Upon loading, all list entries should be checked against the database.
        All entries that reflect non-existent users should be removed.
        For all valid entries, "authorized by them" reflects whether that user
         has this user listed and authorized in the appropriate section.
      </p>
      <p>
        When add user is hit, the name should be checked against the database,
         and if it is present, a new entry should be added, with "authorized by you"
         reflecting user input and "authorized by them" reflecting the value retrieved
         from the database.
        The database should be updated to reflect the new authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Checking or unchecking "authorized by you" on an established list entry
         should be reflected in the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitting the remove button on any user should remove that user from the list
         and should be reflected in the database.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules for Availability Page</h3>
      <p>
        Hitting the "new" button should create a new entry on the list and the database.
        Changes on each rule should be reflected in the database.
        Hitting the delete button on a rule should remove it from the list and the database.
      </p>
      <h3>Activity Scheduler Page</h3>
      <p>
        List on top comes from other authorized users in the user account that are authorized both ways.
        All deselected by default: changes here alter highlights below.
      </p>
      <p>
        User selecting date icon filters the display below to that date.
        User selecting time icon causes display to start at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time in the timescroll portion to be highlighted if it lies within the user's rules
         and all of the selected users' rules.
        Selecting the plus icon within one of these highlighted times brings up the add event pop-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the "create event" button is hit in the add event pop-up,
         an event object will be created with the given specifications and added to the user's event list
         and the selected other users' event lists.
      </p>
      <h3>Event Center</h3>
      <p>
        During loading, events should be tested to see if they are over.
        If they are over, they should be removed from the list and the user account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a page is loading, if a user has unread events,
         the event center link in the nav should highlight.
        If a user has events in the event center, but all are read,
         the event center link should highlight a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking the delete icon on an event removes that event from the list and the user account.
      </p>
